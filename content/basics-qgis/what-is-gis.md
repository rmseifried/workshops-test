## Map layers
{:toc}

GIS stands for **Geographic Information Systems** (or **Geographic Information Science**, depending on who you ask). It's a handy tool for:
* Managing spatial data
* Analyzing patterns
* Creating maps

One way to think about GIS is that it allows us to represent the real world as a collection of abstract, spatial data layers.
