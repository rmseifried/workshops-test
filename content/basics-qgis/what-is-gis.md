## Overview
{:toc}

GIS stands for *Geographic Information Systems* (or *Geographic Information Science*, depending on who you ask). It's a handy tool and/or approach for:
* Managing spatial data
* Analyzing patterns
* Creating maps

Chances are, you've already interacted with a GIS application. Here are some examples:
* [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)
* [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dashboard](https://bit.ly/2SHStbG)
* [Kenneth Field's map of the 2016 presidential election 2016](http://arcg.is/5LuOb0)

## Map layers
{:toc}

The examples of GIS applications have a lot of things in common:
* They all feature a map interface that allows you to zoom in/out and pan
* They all use the map to show some kind of data
* They display the data as layers overlaying a base image

In fact, thinking about GIS as a layer cake is one of the fun visuals that "intro to GIS" courses usually start with. In a way, GIS allows us to take the real world and turn it into a collection of abstract, spatial data layers.

## Data types and data organization
{:toc}

In this section, we'll dive into the data that makes up the layers in a GIS... and how best to keep it all organized!
