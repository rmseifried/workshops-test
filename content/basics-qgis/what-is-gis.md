## Map layers
{:toc}

GIS stands for **Geographic Information Systems** (or **Geographic Information Science**, depending on who you ask). It's a handy tool for:
* Managing spatial data
* Analyzing patterns
* Creating maps

One way to think about GIS is that it allows us to represent the real world as a collection of abstract, spatial data layers.

GIS is all around us! Chances are, you've already interacted with a GIS application. Here are some examples:
* [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)
* [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dashboard](https://bit.ly/2SHStbG)
* [Kenneth Field's map of the 2016 presidential election 2016](http://arcg.is/5LuOb0)
