## Overview
{:toc}

Coordinate systems allow us to locate any place on the earthâ€™s surface. There are two kinds of coordinate systems:
* Geographic coordinate systems - for 3D surfaces like globes
* Projected coordinate systems - for 2D surfaces like maps

There are over 6,000 coordinate systems (and counting). In general, it is a good idea to use a single system for all the data in your project. 

In this section, you'll learn about the differences between these two systems. You'll also learn how to identify the coordinate system of a specific data layer, change the coordinate system of your map view, and change the data's coordinate system.

## Resources

These are some of my favorite coordinate system tools:

* [EPSG.io](https://epsg.io/): search for information about over 6,000 coordinate systems
* [FCC DMC-to-Decimal converter](https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/dms-decimal): quickly convert coordinates from Degrees Minutes Seconds to Decimal Degrees (and vice versa)
* [Rick King's State Plane Coordinate System](https://www.ret3.net/p/state-plane-coordinate-system.html): look up the State Plane and UTM Zones for each county in the U.S.
