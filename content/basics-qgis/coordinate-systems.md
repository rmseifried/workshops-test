# Coordinate Systems
{: .no_toc }

One of the most mind-bending aspects of GIS, coordinate systems are key to how geospatial data works.

## Overview
{:toc}

Coordinate systems (CS) allow us to locate any place on the earthâ€™s surface.

At their most basic, a coordinate pair consists of two numbers: an **X value (longitude)** and a **Y value (latitude)**. The CS is the key to understanding what those numbers mean. The same location could have thousands of different coordinate pairs - one for every CS that exists today!

It is a good idea to use the same system for all the data in your project. This section will show you how to identify a data layer's CS and how to change it, if necessary.

There are two kinds of  systems:
* **Geographic coordinate systems** are best suited for 3D surfaces like globes.
* **Projected coordinate systems** are designed to display locations on flat surfaces like maps and computer screens.

## Identify a layer's CS
{:toc}

The quick way to find out a layer's CS is to open it in QGIS and look at its information in the `Properties` window. These steps work for both vector and raster data.

Refer back to the [Getting Started page](https://umass-gis.github.io/workshops/content/basics-qgis/getting-started.html#explore-the-qgis-interface) to familiarize yourself with the QGIS interface.

### Step 1: Open the layer in QGIS
{:.no_toc}

There are several ways to open a layer in QGIS:
1. In the Browser Panel, navigate to the layer, then drag and drop it into the Map View.
1. For vectors: click `Layer > Add Layer > Add Vector Layer...` or click the `Add Vector Layer...` button. In the window that opens, to the right of the `Vector Dataset(s)` box, click the three buttons `...` to open the file explorer. Navigate to the file, click `Open`, then `Add`.
1. For rasters: click `Layer > Add Layer > Add Raster Layer...` or click the `Add Raster Layer...` button. Follow the steps above.

### Step 2: Open the layer's Properties window

In the Layers Panel, right-click the layer's name and select `Properties...` Information about the CS will appear in the top part of the window, next to CRS (coordinate reference system).

In this example, the CS is [EPSG:26986 - NAD83 / Massachusetts Mainland - Projected](https://epsg.io/26986), which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts uses for most of its GIS data.

## Troubleshooting
{:toc}

Faulty coordinate systems are very often to blame for a GIS that stops working properly. 

These are some of the most common issues that pop up. If your data isn't displaying properly, check to see if one of these could be the cause:
* the data layer's CS information is wrong,
* the data layer's CS information is missing,
* the Map View is set to a different CS than the data layer,
* there are multiple data layers and they all have different CS's.

## Resources

These are some of my favorite coordinate system tools:

* [EPSG.io](https://epsg.io/): search for information about over 6,000 coordinate systems
* [FCC DMC-to-Decimal converter](https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/dms-decimal): quickly convert coordinates from Degrees Minutes Seconds to Decimal Degrees (and vice versa)
* [Rick King's State Plane Coordinate System](https://www.ret3.net/p/state-plane-coordinate-system.html): look up the State Plane and UTM Zones for each county in the U.S.
