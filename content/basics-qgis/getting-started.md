# Getting Started

QGIS is a free and open-source software that runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems. In order to complete the tuturial part of this workshop, you will need to download the software and install it on your personal computer. I would recommend installing the long-term release (LTR), currently 3.10.
