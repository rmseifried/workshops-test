This tutorial will give you a chance to practice the lessons covered in this workshop:
* becoming familiar with the QGIS interface
* opening data layers
* organizing data on your hard drive
* managing CRS's
* changing layer symbology
* exporting a map

We'll focus on the cities of Holyoke and Chicopee in western Massachusetts to explore how the demographic makeup of these places has changed in the last 80 years. 

#### Data Source 1: Historical Redlining
{.no_toc}
Holyoke and Chicopee were mapped by Home Owners' Loan Corporation between 1935 and 1940 - the very program that originated the term “redlining” to describe reputedly ‘hazardous’ neighborhoods that mortgage lenders should avoid at all costs. The project [Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=13/42.182/-72.631&mapview=graded&city=holyoke-chicopee-ma) has georeferenced the maps and made them available to the public as downloadable data (in shapefile and geoJSON format). The website is an interactive mapping platform that is a great learning tool in itself, but we're going to download just a selection of this data.

#### Data Source 2: Contemporary Demographics (+ Politics)
{.no_toc}
In order to explore how the population of Holyoke and Chicopee have changed over time, we'll take a look at the most recent election data from the precincts in these areas, along with data from the 2010 Decennial Census. The project [OpenPrecincts](https://openprecincts.org/ma/) is a great place to look for processed election data. The level of processing is variable by state, but for Massachusetts the data is excellent. The same data (for MA) can be found on the [Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group's (MGGG) GitHub repository](https://github.com/mggg-states/MA-shapefiles).
