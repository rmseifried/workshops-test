# Design a Static Map

Learn how to create a visually appealing map that you can print out or export using the free and open-source mapping software, QGIS. By the end of the workshop, you will be able to:
* Use the QGIS Print Layout tool to design a map
* Apply cartographic best practices to make the map accessible, reproducible, and easy to read
* Export the map as an image file or PDF

This workshop is geared toward folks with a basic understanding of GIS concepts. If you need help getting started with QGIS, check out the [Learn the Basics of QGIS](../basics-qgis) tutorial first.
