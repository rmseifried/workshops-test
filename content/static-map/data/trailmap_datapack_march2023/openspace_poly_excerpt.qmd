  <title>Protected and Recreational OpenSpace (Polygons)</title>
  <abstract>The protected and recreational open space datalayer contains the boundaries of conservation lands and outdoor recreational facilities in Massachusetts. The associated database contains relevant information about each parcel, including ownership, level of protection, public accessibility, assessor’s map and lot numbers, and related legal interests held on the land, including conservation restrictions. Conservation and outdoor recreational facilities owned by federal, state, county, municipal, and nonprofit enterprises are included in this datalayer. Not all lands in this layer are protected in perpetuity, though nearly all have at least some level of protection.
Although the initial data collection effort for this data layer has been completed, open space changes continually and this data layer is therefore considered to be under development. Additionally, due to the collaborative nature of this data collection effort, the accuracy and completeness of open space data varies across the state’s municipalities. Attributes, while comprehensive in scope, may be incomplete for many parcels.
The OpenSpace layer includes two feature classes:
OPENSPACE_POLY - polygons of recreational and conservation lands as described above
OPENSPACE_ARC - attributed lines that represent boundaries of the polygons
These feature classes are stored in an ArcSDE feature dataset named OPENSPACE that includes ArcGIS geodatabase topology. 
OPENSPACE_POLY - The following types of land are included in this datalayer:
conservation land- habitat protection with minimal recreation, such as walking trails 
recreation land- outdoor facilities such as town parks, commons, playing fields, school fields, golf courses, bike paths, scout camps, and fish and game clubs. These may be privately or publicly owned facilities. 
town forests 
parkways - green buffers along roads, if they are a recognized conservation resource 
agricultural land- land protected under an Agricultural Preservation Restriction (APR) and administered by the state Department of Agricultural Resources (DAR, formerly the Dept. of Food and Agriculture (DFA)) 
aquifer protection land - not zoning overlay districts 
watershed protection land - not zoning overlay districts 
cemeteries - if a recognized conservation or recreation resource
forest land -- if designated as a Forest Legacy Area

  <history>Editors of protected open spaces that include the Division of Fish and Game, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Conservation and Recreation and the Division of Conservation Services, have continued to improve the dataset by adding many new fee-acquisitions or restrictions that were acquired in FY 2013. Acquisitions for FY 2014 have also begun to be digitized. Dozens of new conservation restrictions that were acquired in-part by the new Conservation Land Tax Credit program have been digitized as well.</history>

  <constraints type="Limitations of use">These data are very useful for most statewide and regional planning purposes. However, they are not a legal record of ownership, and the user should understand that parcel representations are generally not based on property surveys.</constraints>
