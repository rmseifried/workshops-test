  <title>DCR Roads and Trails (Points)</title>
  <abstract>This dataset represents all point features identified along roads and trails on Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation - Division of State Parks and Recreation properties (as well as some of the Urban Parks - eventually all of these properties will be integrated into this dataset). Field work was conducted during the years 2005 to 2015 by independent contractors and DCR staff. Thirty two types of point features were identified as were numerous attributes specific to that point feature but only 20 of them are included in this release as the other 12 point types are for internal use only. 
This updates the dataset released by MassGIS on 3/18/2014.

This dataset is intended to give an approximation of point information and condition as of the date of the actual fieldwork. GPS units were used that were capable of 2 meter accuracy with post processing.
