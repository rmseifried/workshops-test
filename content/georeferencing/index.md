# Georeference a Historical Map

Historical maps (and aerial photos!) can reveal what the world used to look like before modern infrastructure was built and natural events altered the course of rivers or changed where people could live. In this workshop you will learn how to:
* Find historical maps and photos online
* Georeference maps and photos using QGIS
* Identify high-quality ground control points
* Manage the data for a georeferencing project

This workshop is geared toward folks with a basic understanding of GIS concepts. If you need help getting started with QGIS, check out the [Learn the Basics of QGIS](https://umass-gis.github.io/workshops/content/basics-qgis/) tutorial first.
