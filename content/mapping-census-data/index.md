# Making Maps with U.S. Census Data

This workshop will focus on ways to access data directly from the U.S. Census Bureau. Specifically, you will learn how to:
* Find data on the U.S. Census Bureau's website
* Explore the data with an interactive web map in your browser
* Download data tables and geospatial files to your computer
* Open the data in QGIS to make your own maps

This workshop is geared toward folks with a basic understanding of GIS concepts. If you need help getting started with QGIS, check out the [Learn the Basics of QGIS](https://umass-gis.github.io/workshops/content/basics-qgis/) tutorial first.
