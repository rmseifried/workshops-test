## Software Introduction
{:toc}
**[Basics of ArcGIS Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFYG9oEV1EE&t=720s)**
<br>Geoinformatics, 2018

This video walkthrough (~40 mins) introduces basic processes and functions of ArcGIS Pro

## Projections
**[Projections (ArcGIS Pro)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MKyts2e0Ww&list=WL&index=8&t=123s)**
<br>Jeff Sun, 2019

This video (~15 mins) covers the basics of checking and manipulating projections within ArcGIS Pro
*Specific Processes in this tutorial:*

* [How to check current layer’s projection](https://youtu.be/2MKyts2e0Ww?t=199)  

* [How to check current map projection](https://youtu.be/2MKyts2e0Ww?t=230)
<br>This, in conjunction with the above process, can be used to verify that map and layers share the same projection

* [How to change map projection to specific timezone](https://youtu.be/2MKyts2e0Ww?t=266)
<br>Note: project on the fly function doesn’t change the projection of the original data, just the version of it in your map file.

* [How to use “Define Projection” to align data that has an “Unknown Projection” to your map](https://youtu.be/2MKyts2e0Ww?t=673)
 <br>Note: you will need to know the projection the data was originally created with in order to complete this process. Sometimes this information is available from the source (website, institution, person who sent you data, etc.)

## Layouts
**[Layouts (ArcGIS Pro)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ9ei4-23MM)**
<br>ArcGIS, 2019
<br> This video (~ 4 mins) provides instruction on creating map layouts in ArcGIS Pro

**[Layouts (ArcMap)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Z8XXJj-fs)**
<br>Don Boyes, 2012
<br>This video (~5 mins) covers methods to adjust map layouts and page orientation in ArcMap

**[Editing Legends (ArcMap)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCc6y7cbPt8)**
<br>GIS with Dr. Russel, 2018
<br>This video (~13 mins) walks through the steps to create and edit legends in ArcMap

## Data Manipulation

**[Georeferencing Historical Aerial Photography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PORJevqTy4c)**
<br>Moulay Anwar Sounny-Slitine, 2018
<br>This video (~16 min) walks through the steps to georeference historical maps and unreferenced raster layers.

**[Table Joins and Relates (ArcGIS Pro)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuhCl-6vtOY)**
<br>eGIS Associates, 2020
<br>This video introduces the reasons to perform table joins and relates, and covers various methods to perform these functions.

*Specific topics within this video:*

* [Different ways this function can be performed](https://youtu.be/KuhCl-6vtOY?t=93)

* [Cardinality](https://youtu.be/KuhCl-6vtOY?t=174)
<br>Defining primary and secondary datasets, determining how many features from one dataset match up with features from the other.

* [Introduction to table Joins](https://youtu.be/KuhCl-6vtOY?t=376)

* [Introduction to table Relates](https://youtu.be/KuhCl-6vtOY?t=629)

* [Performing the Table Join](https://youtu.be/KuhCl-6vtOY?t=1280)

* [Steps to Perform Table Relates](https://youtu.be/KuhCl-6vtOY?t=1483)
