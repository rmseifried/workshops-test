## Overview
{:toc}

This exercise is *not meant to be a complete step-by-step tutorial*. You can watch the workshop recording if you would like to follow along with the demo.

Ujaval Gandhi's [Web Mapping with QGIS2Web (QGIS3)](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/web_mapping_with_qgis2web.html) is an excellent step-by-step tutorial that you can follow along using the data from this workshop.

Also be sure to check out the [qgis2web GitHub repo](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web) where Tom Chadwin posts information and details about the plugin.

## Design a map

The first step is to create a map in QGIS. For the demo, I'm using a single point layer that has a mixture of categorical and quantitative data. Feel free to use your own data, or follow along by downloading the data pack I'm using.

[Get the  data pack](https://github.com/umass-gis/workshops/blob/main/content/basics-qgis/data/Data_QGIS_Fall2020.zip){: .btn .btn-purple }
