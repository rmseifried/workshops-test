## Overview
{:toc}

This is an evolving workshop that is designed to introduce you to storymapping. While there are several storymapping platforms out there, this one will focus on [Esri's ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/). By the end of the workshop, you will be able to:
* Create an engaging storymap outline
* Log into the ArcGIS Online platform
* Create a new storymap project
* Add text, media, and map content
* Publish and share your storymap

## Explore Examples
{:toc}

StoryMaps are a creative, web-based platform for telling stories. They are inherently interactive, allowing users to scroll, click, and explore different media elements. StoryMaps aren't just about maps... you can also include photos, videos, sound recordings, embedded websites and YouTube videos, etc.

Take a few minutes to explore some of these examples, paying attention to how the storytellers used different media to capture your attention:

## Understand the Workflow
{:toc}

Creating an engaging StoryMap starts with a solid plan about what story you want to tell and what media you will include to bring the story to life.

**Step 1: Outline the story**
<br>Create a Word or Google doc (or even a scrap piece of paper!) to outline the story from start to finish.

**Step 2: Plan what media to include**
<br>Once you have a sense of the story arc, think about what media will be best-suited to illustrate points in the story. Try to use different types of media (photos, videos, maps) and be strategic about where to use them. Gather the media together in one place so you'll be ready to drop it into the story.

**Step 3: Create the StoryMap**
<br>Log into the ArcGIS StoryMaps platform, create a new StoryMap project, and add your contet.

**Step 4: Publish and share the story**
<br>Once the story is ready to go, publish it and share the link with your classmates or with the wider world.

**Learning Resources**
* [Get to know ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/paths/getting-to-know-the-new-storymaps/). Learning path with articles and tutorials that go through the basics of the platform.
* [Planning and outlining your story map: How to set yourself up for success](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-storymaps/sharing-collaboration/planning-and-outlining-your-story-map-how-to-set-yourself-up-for-success/). Blog post with tips about how to structure your story.
