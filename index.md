## Meet the instructor

Hi! I'm Dr. Becky Seifried, the Geospatial Information Librarian at UMass Amherst. Before becoming a librarian, I was a research archaeologist who learned how to use GIS out in the field. A lot of my experience with GIS comes from working on projects where I collected geospatial data, georectified historical maps,  interpreted satellite imagery, and more.

Got a question about GIS? Email me at [rseifried@umass.edu](mailto:rseifried@umass.edu) or [book a consultation](https://libcal.library.umass.edu/appointments/gis) to meet with me one-on-one.
